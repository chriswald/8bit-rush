  <h1>Dialogue File (.dlg) Specifications</h1>
  <p>Dialogue Files are used to build the dialogue tree of a Non
  Player Character (NPC). The name of a dialogue file must be the same
  as the name of the image used for the NPC.</p>

  <h2>Formatting Specifications</h2>
  <p>The first line of the file is always the Title of the root
  node. Lines that contain Title text are denoted by beginning with
  '^'. Lines of body text have no denoting character. Nesting is
  denoted by number of indentations (see note on indentation
  below). For example, the root node, being the first line, has no
  indentation, but every child of that root node should be indented
  once. A line's parent will be the closest previous line which has
  one less level of indentation.</p>

  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p>One level of indentation is defined as either one tab (read as
  '\t') or four spaces.</p>
