  <h1>Level File Specifications</h1>
  <p>This file specifies all information needed for each level to
  load, from what images to use as backgrounds to where to place the
  enemies. Each line starts with one of several tokens which identify
  how to handle the information presented on that line.</p>

  <p><strong>Level Header Information</strong> - This line is used to
  define the dimensions of the level as well as global information
  about the blocks. This must be the first line of the file, excluding
  comment lines. The width and height of the level are measured in
  number of blocks. Individual block dimensions are measured in
  pixels.</p>
  <p><strong>Block Specification</strong> - These lines define
  information for every block, including X and Y placement, the image
  file to use for the block and the collision code for the block (See
  notes for specifications on the collision code). X and Y placement
  values are measured in number of blocks from the top left corner of
  the level.</p>
  <p><strong>Player Information</strong> - This line is used to define
  the location in which the player shall be placed when the level
  begins as well as the image file to use for the player. The X and Y
  positions are defined in number of blocks from the upper left corner
  of the level.</p>
  <p><strong>Background Layer Information</strong> - These lines
  define information about the images to use for background layers. X
  and Y positions are measured in pixels from the upper left corner of
  the level. Images are layered, meaning that the image of the first
  line encountered will be at the back when compiled and the image of
  the last line encountered will be formost behind the blocks.</p>
  <p><strong>Enemy Information</strong> - These lines define all of
  the enemies to be present in the level, including which image to
  use, where they should be placed when the level starts, and their
  initial X and Y velocity. X and Y placement is defined in number of
  blocks from the upper left corner of the level. X and Y velocity is
  defined in pixels per update. Updates are timed to occur roughly
  once every 1/30 sec.</p>
  <p><strong>Non-Player Character (NPC) Information</strong> - These
  lines define all of the NPC's to be present in the level, including
  which image to use, where they should be placed when the level
  starts, and their initial X and Y velocity. X and Y placement is
  defined in number of blocks from the upper left corner of the
  level. X and Y velocity is defined in pixels per update. Updates are
  timed to occur roughly once every 1/30 sec.</p>
  <p><strong>Comment</strong> - These lines are used simply to make
  the file more readable and should be used to increase clairty. They
  are not included in line counts, and as such can occur before the
  Line Header.</p>

  <br/><h2>Notes</h2>
  <p>The "<strong>Collision Code</strong>" is a 4 diget binary number
  where a one (1) represents "true" and a zero (0) represents
  "false". Each diget represents whether a certain side is
  "collidable", that is whether a player, enemy, etc. should trigger a
  collision event upon colliding with that side of the block. Each
  diget represents a side, ordered top, right, bottom, left when
  reading from left to right. For example a code of "1011" mean that a
  block is "solid" on the top, bottom, and left sides, but not the
  right side.</p>
  <p>"X position" and "Y position" are specified in block-widths and
  block heights respectivly from the upper left corner of the
  screen.</p>
  <p>"X velocity" and "Y velocity" are specified in pixels per
  update. An update occures approximately once every 1/30 sec.</p>
  <p>The "Level Header" line must be the first line in the file, not
  counting comments. All other lines may occur in any order, however
  good style is to group lines specifiying similar content.</p>
  <p>Order that background images are specified in the file matters!
  Images will be "stacked" as they are encountered, meaning that the
  first image specified will be at that back and the last on specified
  will be at the front.</p>
