  <h1>Level File Specifications</h1>
  <p>This file specifies all information needed for each level to
  load, from what images to use as backgrounds to where to place the
  enemies. Each line starts with one of several tokens which identify
  how to handle the information presented on that line.</p>

  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p>"X position" and "Y position" are specified in block-widths and
  block heights respectivly from the upper left corner of the
  screen.</p>
  <p>"X velocity" and "Y velocity" are specified in pixels per
  update. An update occures approximately once every 1/30 second.</p>
  <p>The "Collision Code" is a 4 diget binary number where a one (1)
  represents "true" and a zero (0) represents "false". Each diget
  represents whether a certain side is "collidable", that is whether a
  player, enemy, etc. should trigger a collision event upon colliding
  with that side of the block. Each diget represents a side, ordered
  top, right, bottom, left when reading from left to right. For
  example a code of "1011" mean that a block is "solid" on the top,
  bottom, and left sides, but not the right side.</p>
  <p>The "Level Header" line must be the first line in the file, not
  counting comments. All other lines may occur in any order, however
  good style is to group lines specifiying similar content.</p>
